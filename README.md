#  Cybersecurity Awareness Bot — Liam (WPF Edition)

A C# / WPF desktop application that educates users about cybersecurity best practices through an interactive, keyword-driven chat interface. Built across three parts, the final version includes a task assistant, quiz mini-game, NLP simulation, and a full activity log. Designed to be extensible, professionally structured, and easy to run on any Windows machine with .NET 9 installed.

##  Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 9 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (or higher)
- Windows OS (required for WPF and `System.Media.SoundPlayer`)
- Visual Studio 2022+ **or** VS Code with the C# extension

### Run with Visual Studio

1. Open `CybersecurityBot.csproj` in Visual Studio.
2. Press **F5** or click **Start**.
3. The WPF window will launch.

### Run with the .NET CLI

```bash
cd CybersecurityBot
dotnet restore
dotnet run

```

The application will start and display the main chat window.

---

##  Optional Voice Greeting

Place a file named `greeting.wav` in the build output folder:

```
bin/Debug/net9.0-windows/greeting.wav
```

If the file is absent, the application continues silently without error.

##  How to Use

### Chat
Type any cybersecurity question or topic naturally. Examples:
- `"How do I create a strong password?"`
- `"Tell me about phishing"`
- `"What is ransomware?"`
- `"Tell me more"` — expands on the last topic

### Task Assistant
Manage your cybersecurity to-do list with natural language:

| Command | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Add a task | `add task - Enable two-factor authentication` |
| Add with reminder | `add task - Update my passwords in 3 days` |
| Add (natural phrasing) | `remind me to review my privacy settings` |
| View all tasks | `view tasks` |
| Complete a task | `complete task 1` |
| Delete a task | `delete task 2` |
| Set a reminder | `set reminder for task 1 tomorrow` |

Each task is automatically given a helpful description based on the topic (passwords, 2FA, backups, etc.).

### Quiz Mini-Game
Test your cybersecurity knowledge with 10 randomised questions per session:

```
start quiz
```

- Answer with **A**, **B**, **C**, or **D** (or **A** / **B** for true/false questions)
- Immediate feedback and explanation after every answer
- Final score with personalised feedback (80%+ = cybersecurity pro!)
- Type `stop quiz` at any time to exit early

### Activity Log
View a timestamped summary of everything the bot has done:

```
show activity log
```

Also triggered by: `"what have you done for me?"` or `"recent actions"`

Displays the last 10 actions across four categories: **Task**, **Quiz**, **NLP**, and **Chat**.

### Example Session

```
User:    "Clinton"
Liam:    "Good morning, Clinton! 👋 Great to meet you."

User:    "add task - Enable 2FA on all accounts"
Liam:    "📋 Task added! [1] Enable 2FA on all accounts
          Would you like to set a reminder?"

User:    "in 3 days"
Liam:    "🔔 Got it! I'll remind you on 22 Jun 2026."

User:    "start quiz"
Liam:    "🧩 CYBERSECURITY QUIZ STARTED! Q1: What should
          you do if you receive an email asking for your
          password? A) Reply  B) Delete  C) Report  D) Ignore"

User:    "C"
Liam:    "✅ Correct! Reporting phishing emails helps protect others."

User:    "show activity log"
Liam:    "📋 Here are the last 3 actions:
          1. [09:14] Quiz: Quiz started
          2. [09:13] Task: Task added: 'Enable 2FA on all accounts'
          3. [09:13] Chat: Session started for Clinton"
```

##  Architecture Notes

### Design patterns used

| Pattern | Where |
|---------|-------|
| **Delegate + Event** | `ConversationContext.OnActivity` — decoupled activity logging |
| **Strategy (delegate)** | `ResponseEngine.SelectResponse` — swappable response-selection logic |
| **Auto-properties** | `UserProfile`, `ConversationContext`, `CyberTask` — clean state |
| **Sealed classes** | `UserProfile`, `ConversationContext`, `TaskStore`, `QuizEngine`, `ActivityLogger` |
| **Static helpers** | `CommandHelper`, `SentimentDetector`, `ResponseEngine`, `NlpParser` — stateless utilities |
| **LINQ** | `TaskStore.GetPending()`, `ActivityLogger.BuildSummary()` — collection querying |
| **Regex** | `NlpParser` — flexible intent and timeframe extraction from free text |

### Extending the response engine

Add a new entry to the `Responses` dictionary in `ResponseEngine.cs`:

```csharp
["your keyword"] = new[]
{
    "First alternative response.",
    "Second alternative response.",
},
```

Then add the display label to `TopicList` — the UI chip will appear automatically.

### Extending the quiz

Add questions to the `Bank` array in `QuizEngine.cs`:

```csharp
new QuizQuestion(
    "Your question text here?",
    new[] { "A) Option one", "B) Option two", "C) Option three", "D) Option four" },
    correctIndex: 2,   // zero-based, so C = index 2
    "Explanation shown after the user answers."
),
```
